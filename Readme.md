## About The Project

This project consists in creating a virtual sudoku. The aim is to detect the hand of the user, then write click and the case we want to fill, then write the digit manually and finally detect this digit to write it in the case. At the end the algorithm must say if it's correct or not (optional part - this one is more based on AI)

### Installation

Please make sure that "make" is installed :

```bash
sudo apt-get install make
```

Then do this command at the root of the project (after having cloned it): 

```bash
make install
```

It will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies in it.

Once it is done, enter the virtual environment : 

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can work on the project! 
Don't forget to enter the environment each time you want to work on it.
If we add some dependencies in the requirements.txt, be sure to do "make install" again to have them.
